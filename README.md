### Grow Light and Reflector
To survive the dark winter months, the plants need light. Lighting is a big topic and many have strong opinions on it.

Regardless of what your favourite is, [CFL:s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_fluorescent_lamp) are the go-to alternative for cheap, reliable and efficient ligting. There might be better alternatives, but then you need to shell out a lot more money.

I bought an [Electrox Grow, 125W](http://www.elektrox.de/en/seite1_en.html) and it performs very well for me. Ignorable heat and a lot of light.

In addition to the light, you will need a reflector. I bought my light in a kit which included a reflector. Something like [this](http://www.ebay.de/itm/Elektrox-125-W-125-Watt-Dual-ESL-CFL-Wuchs-Blute-2100K-inkl-Reflektor-/321824373773?hash=item4aee3a3c0d:g:zrcAAOSwT6pVwe4s). Cost: About â‚¬50 for lamp and reflector.


### The Pump
An aquarium pump is silent and provides enough lift to cirulate the water from the tank to the grow tray above it.

I use an [Eheim compact 300](http://www.amazon.de/Eheim-1000220-compact-Aquarienpumpe-300/dp/B000A2162Y/ref=pd_bia_nav_t_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=06MFMJK2EXJ20SDJ3KZG). The main advatage, outside of being affordable and of high quality, is that the flow rate is easy to set.

### Grow Tent (DIY)

Light will be your most scarce resource and the electricity needed most likely the most expensive factor in day-to-day operations. It is important not to waste it. This means you need to encase the garden in a small reflective tent to make sure as much light as possible is going to the plants.

For my grow tent, I bought [reflective mylar sheeting](http://www.hydroponics.eu/lighting-c-24/reflective-sheeting-s-187/mylar-reflective-sheeting-25545.html) and used it as walls on an metallic Ikea shelf. See photos below.
